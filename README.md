# Desktop Speaker Stand
 An elegant two-piece desktop monitor stand designed in OpenSCAD. The top of the stand attaches to the base via 4 attached pins.

 There is a recessed 6mm cable channel running along the back that facilitates clean cable management. When properly sized the cable should be flush to the surface.

## Print Instructions
**Special Instructions:** Make sure Desktop-Monitor-Stand-Top is printed with the pins facing upwards. Supports will be necessary to ensure proper rounding of the edges for both models.
Rubber feet are optional as the stand does not slide much on a standard Ikea wood desk. For added weight, you can poke a hole at the top of Desktop-Monitor-Stand-Top and fill it with a fine sand. A gyroid infill pattern allows it to be mostly filled with enough tapping and patience.
- Originally printed on a Prusa Mini+ using black eSun PLA+ filament
- Sliced in PrusaSlicer with 0.2mm layer height, supports everywhere, 15% gyroid infill.

## Planned Updates
The following are planned in no particular order:
- Utilize variables to quickly change the size of the cable channel
- Utilize variables to quickly switch between different base and center shapes
- ~~Optimize corner rounding to remove the necessity of supports~~
