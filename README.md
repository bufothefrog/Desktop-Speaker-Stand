 An elegant two-piece desktop monitor stand designed in OpenSCAD. The top of the stand attaches to the base via 4 attached pins.

 There is a recessed 6mm cable channel running along the back that facilitates clean cable management. When properly sized the cable should be flush to the surface.

## Print Instructions
*Special Instructions*: Make sure Desktop-Monitor-Stand-Top is printed with the pins facing upwards. Supports will be necessary to ensure proper rounding of the edges. 
## Planned Updates
The following are planned in no particular order:
- Utilize variables to quickly change the size of the cable channel
- Utilize variables to quickly switch between different base and center shapes
- Optimize corner rounding to remove the necessity of supports
