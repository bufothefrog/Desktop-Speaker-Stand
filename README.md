 An elegant two-piece desktop monitor stand designed in OpenSCAD. The top of the stand attaches to the base via 4 attached pins.

 There is a recessed 6mm cable channel running along the back that facilitates clean cable management. When properly sized the cable should be flush to the surface.

There are also 8 printable TPU anti-vibration feet that will reduce the vibrations and help the stand stay steady.

## Print Instructions
**Special Instructions:** Make sure Desktop-Monitor-Stand-Top is printed with the pins facing upwards. Support are not needed for this model.
For added weight, you can poke a hole at the top of Desktop-Monitor-Stand-Top and fill it with a fine sand. A gyroid infill pattern allows it to be mostly filled with enough tapping and patience.
- Originally printed on a Prusa Mini+ using black eSun PLA+ filament
- Sliced in PrusaSlicer with 0.2mm layer height, supports everywhere, 15% gyroid infill.

## Planned Updates
The following are planned in no particular order:
- Utilize variables to quickly change the size of the cable channel
- Utilize variables to quickly switch between different base and center shapes
- ~~Optimize corner rounding to remove the necessity of supports~~
